## spamfilter

Building a spam filter for our mini-project

### Initial plan of action

- [x] classify the dataset as spam or ham
  - [x] make a training set
  - [x] make a testing set (against which we will test our trained model)
- Machine learning models to be tested upon
  - [ ] Naive Bayes
  - [ ] Logistic regression
  - [ ] Linear SVM
  - **more to come**
- To make a voting system which will take the best out of all the
classifiers (increasing the accuracy is the aim)

**More to come** 

## To the team members

**Make an issue if you have any query**

- before developing a feature, please create a seperate branch from the master
as this will reduce merge conflicts, 

```sh
$ git checkout -b <username>/<feature_to_implement>
```
