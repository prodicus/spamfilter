## spamfilter

Building a spam filter for our mini-project

### Initial plan of action

- [x] classify the dataset as spam or ham
  - [x] make a training set
  - [x] make a testing set (against which we will test our trained model)
- Machine learning models to be tested upon
  - [ ] Naive Bayes
  - [ ] Logistic regression
  - [ ] Linear SVM
  - **more to come**
- To make a voting system which will take the best out of all the
classifiers (increasing the accuracy is the aim)

**More to come**
